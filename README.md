# Asciimon
Pokemon-inspired game created using Rust for ANSI terminals

This is my first project using Rust, so feel free to point out anything "not Rusty" in the code :)

## Contributing

The game is early in developement, and so I am regulrally making changes to the code.

Because of this, contributions will likely be unable to be merged, or possibly change things without considering plans I have for the game.

So for now I am not going to be accepting any pull requests of ANY kind (At least until the game has matured a bit)

## Running
